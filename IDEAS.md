# Ideas for next Blockbuster versions

There's some ideas that I want to implement in next Blockbuster mod: 

* Scripted recording addition to player's recording
    * Explanation: Some of the stuff isn't possible when you use player's 
      recording, like killing other actor or player. Scripted recording will 
      add a new spin to your machinimas and cinematics. 
      
      With scripted recording you'll be able to specify different behavior like: 
      run over there, and then fight other actor in the sight, if he lowers your HP to 
      5, run like a pussy, and jump into lava. Something like that. 
* Support of multi-player world skins
* Rewrite recording code (pixel -> vector, I'll get what I mean)
* Custom actor actions (like dancing, waving with hands like crazy person, or making a blow kiss)
* Animating actor skins (basically to create illusion of lip syncing or eyes blinking)  
* Mention role plays in README.md

## Things needed to be done before update

This is my list for what I should do before releasing an update:

- Make sure that everything works
- Make sure that version number is everywhere correct
    - In `Blockbuster.java`
    - In `build.gradle`
    - In `mcmod.info`
- Make sure that `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` have correct links and that
- Make a github release (tag)
- Post update message and update original post on minecraftforum.net
- Post update message and update original post on minecraftforge.net
- Post update log and update original post on planetminecraft.net
- Post link in twitter
