Blockbuster (**pun intended**) is a Minecraft mod which lets you create simple 
Minecraft machinimas in single player (without having to recruit and organize a 
crowd of actors and cameras).

Blockbuster mod is built on top of Forge 12.18.1.2073 for Minecraft 1.10.2, and 
the recording code is based on the code from the 
[Mocap mod](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1445402-minecraft-motion-capture-mod-mocap-16-000) 
(the author of the mod gave me [permission](http://i.imgur.com/lc1lJB5.png) to use his code). 

## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), then go to 
[releases](https://github.com/mchorse/blockbuster/releases) and download the 
latest stable version (not a pre-release) of jar file. Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game. 

After that, Blockbuster mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's 
mods menu. If Blockbuster didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went 
wrong.

### Machinima Examples

This playlist consists out of videos that I've created during Blockbuster mod testings. Those videos are my lab experiments. Don't judge the quality of these machinimas yet, I'm still learning.
