# Blockbuster

Blockbuster (**pun intended**) is a Minecraft mod which lets you create simple Minecraft machinimas in 
single player (without having to recruit/organize a crowd of actors and cameras) 
and simple cinematics in adventure maps.

Blockbuster mod is built on top of Forge 12.6.1.1907 for Minecraft 1.9, and recording 
code is based on the code borrowed from [Mocap mod](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1445402-minecraft-motion-capture-mod-mocap-16-000) (author of the mod gave me permission 
to use his code). 

[Original minecraft forum thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2700216-blockbuster-create-simple-machinimas-and-adventure). 
Tested on Mac OS X 10.10 only, but in theory suppose to work on any OS.

## Install

Install Minecraft Forge, then go to 
[releases](https://github.com/mchorse/blockbuster/releases) and download the 
latest version jar file. Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, launch the game, 
and done. 

After that, Blockbuster mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's 
mods menu. If Blockbuster didn't appeared in mods menu, then something went 
wrong.
