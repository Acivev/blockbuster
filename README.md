Blockbuster is a Minecraft mod which lets you create Minecraft machinimas in singleplayer using NPC body actors. This mod works with Forge for Minecraft 1.10.2, 1.11.2 and 1.12.2.

Blockbuster mod depends upon [Metamorph](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/metamorph). Every new change log will specify the version of Metamorph supported. Blockbuster is also provides **optional** integration for [Aperture](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/aperture) mod.

Recording is based and rewritten from scratch on recording code from Mocap mod by [EchebKeso](https://twitter.com/EchebKeso).

## Features

Blockbuster mod provides you with lots of features to make cool machinimas:

* **Actors and player recording** – the most important feature, as you won't be able to create a machinimas without it. With Blockbuster mod you can record yourself doing things and then playback it using an actor. *Recording code has some limitations on which actions it can record*. See [Blockbuster Wiki](https://github.com/mchorse/blockbuster/wiki) for more information about limitations.
* **Director blocks** – one actor is good, a crowd of them is even better. Blockbuster mod provides you with a mechanism called *director block* which manages playback of registered actors. It allows you to record actors. It has also outlets for redstone contraptions, making it easy attaching some custom commands or redstone logic on start or the end of the scene playback.
* **[Aperture](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/aperture) support** – camera is how you present your machinima. Blockbuster mod has built-in Aperture integration. When Aperture is loaded, Blockbuster mod provides you with some features such as: ability to attach camera profiles to playback button, and previewing director block playback while editing cameras in the camera editor.
* **Custom models** – recording only player-like entities limits the originality of your machinimas. Blockbuster mod let's you create custom models using [McME](https://mchorse.github.io/mcme/) model editor or in-game integrated model editor. Unleash your creativity with custom models!
* **OBJ models** – beside custom models which can be created with in-game custom model editor, Blockbuster also supports OBJ models on top of custom JSON models!
* **Mobs support** – thanks to [Metamorph](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/metamorph)'s public API, Blockbuster is capable of using any morphs which Metamorph provides to be used by Blockbuster actors.
* **[Minema](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2790594-minema-unofficial-the-smooth-movie-recorder) compatability** – thanks to frame-based player recording and cameras, you can convert your in-game machinimas to videos with a press of a button.

## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), download the latest stable version of jar file for available minecraft version. Also install following mods: [Metamorph](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/metamorph). Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, Blockbuster mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If Blockbuster didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong.

### Machinima Examples

This playlist consists out of videos that I've created a bunch of machinimas during Blockbuster mod testings and just when I felt like. Earlier of those videos are my lab experiments.
