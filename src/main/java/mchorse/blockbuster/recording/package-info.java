/**
 * <p>
 * This package used to be just a little bit refactored version of Mocap mod's
 * recording code, but since 1.3.1 update, this is no longer the same code it
 * used to be.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Since I made enough changes to the source code, I think, I can count this
 * code fully as my own. In 1.3.1, I started from almost scratch: I removed
 * record and play threads and rewrote the recording and playback code from
 * scratch. That's what I remember, git history might disagree with me.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * However, I still going to honor EchebKeso and his Mocap mod, and going to
 * mention his name and/or his mod name, because he gave me a base start for
 * player recording. Thank you, EchebKeso :)
