                {r}Start or stop playback of director block located at {7}<x>{r}, {7}<y>{r}, and {7}<z>{r} (you could use F3 to determine coordinates).
        morph: 
            |
                {l}{6}/{r}morph {7}<model> <skin>{r}
                
                {r}Morphs current player into given {7}<model>{r} with skin named {7}<skin>{r}.

        # Model's commands
        model:
            help: {r}{o}Model command{r}. This command provides sub-commands for managing custom models.

                    {r}Exports model from {7}<entity_name>{r} mob renderer in JSON format that actor use for custom models. This model will be exported into export folder of Blockbuster's config folder.
