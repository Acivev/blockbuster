        # General commands (no SubCommandBase commands)
        director: {l}{6}/{r}director {8}<play|stop>{r} {7}<x> <y> <z>{r}\n\nStart or stop playback of director block located at {7}<x>{r}, {7}<y>{r}, and {7}<z>{r} (you could use F3 to determine coordinates).
        no_director: No director block exists at (%s, %s, %s)
        morph: 
            >
                {l}{6}/{r}morph {7}<model> <skin>{r}
                
                {r}Morphs current player into given {7}<model>{r} with skin named {7}<skin>{r}.

        # Model's commands
        model:
            main: {r}{o}Model command{r}. This command provides sub-commands for managing custom models.
            
            export:
                main: 
                    |
                        {l}{6}/{r}model {8}export{r} {7}<entity_name>{r}
                        
                        {r}Exports model from {7}<entity_name>{r} mob renderer in JSON format that actor use for custom models. This model will be exported into export folder of Blockbuster's config folder.
                        
                        {r}{l}Attention{r}: those models are automatically generated and aren't perfect. You'll need to adjust those models in McME to get best result.
                error_save: Can't save exported model!
                wrong_type: Can't export model for "%s" type (because it has no renderer, or it's not a living entity renderer).
                saved: Entity model "%s" was saved to %s.
            
            request: {l}{6}/{r}model {8}request{r}\n\nRequests models from the server (including host's models in LAN game).

        # Action's commands
        action:

                |
                    {l}{6}/{r}action {8}record{r} {7}<filename>{r}
                    
                    {r}Records an action from current player into given {7}<filename>{r}.
            request: 
                |
                    {l}{6}/{r}action {8}request{r} {7}<filename>{r}
